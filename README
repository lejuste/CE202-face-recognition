This runs a perforance benchmark on face-recognition. 


Given:

Input sizes: 
	X = 1 trillion
	~X, ~X/4, ~X/16, ~X/64, ~X/256

Threads options:
	1,2,4,8


This program outputs multiple text files that contain the values for 
IPC, instructions, task-clock, context-switches, cpu-migrations, page-faults, cycles, branches, branch-misses, L1 MPKI, L2 MPKI, L3 MPKI


Then I chose to manually plot the results using matplot lib.

Program heirarchy:

	RunTest.py (Runs 20 tests will all inputsize and thread options)

		toplev.py (Gets L1 MPKI, L2 MPKI, L3 MPKI)
			runThreads.py (Uses parallel library to simultaneously call program given thread count)
				throughputRun (Runs face-recognition program given an Input size)

		perf stat (Gets IPC, instructions, task-clock, context-switches, cpu-migrations, page-faults, cycles, branches, branch-misses,)
                	runThreads.py (Uses parallel library to simultaneously call program given thread count)
                        	throughputRun (Runs face-recognition program given an Input size)
